One of my colleague in the office uses dvorak layout for his keyboard, and I asked, "Why bother?". And he said, "Try it, and you'll know the answer". But I wasn't convinced, yet.

In my free time I decided to do my own research. One point that I found out is that QWERTY layout was developed to fix key jamming issue (because the typist can type faster than the fallback mechanism of the hammers) by slowing down the typing speed (the corectness of this theory is debateable). And the popularity the QWERTY has now is purely because of its headstart, and a lot of people and industry has already accustomed to this layout, and made it difficult to change to the new keyboard layout.

Dvorak's layout, in the other hand, is created based on research by dr. August Dvorak. The research aims to create a keyboard layout that is more efficient and less prone to causing injury. He considered the word frequency (US Dvorak Layout is optimized for english-US language), the vocal and vowel positioning, among others. More detail can be found in [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dvorak_Simplified_Keyboard). To prove that claims, I decided to give it a shot...

And it was horrible.

In the first days I typed very slowly. Much slower than I anticipated. It's like my thought has already reached the end of the paragraph, but my fingers barely typed two or three words at best. It's kind of frustatrating. And whenever I want to slam my keyboard, I switched to QWERTY instead (super+spacebar in *gnome*). Measured by speed, my speed with QWERTY at that time was around 80 wpm. When I switched to dvorak, it just dropped to sub 10 (no kidding).

And not to mention the extra headache trying to struggle against the muscle memory built on QWERTY in decades...

At first, I found myself using dvorak layout only a few minutes in my 7 hours of working time. And it slowly growing. Slow but sure, in the third week I found myself (and quite surprised too) cannot go back to QWERTY anymore, albeit with severe typing slowdown, plus extra headache. Dvorak is now has taken over my muscle memory built by QWERTY in about 15 years, only within _three weeks_. Now that is awesome.

Was it worth it?

To me, it was totally worth the effort. Dvorak layout has proven its claim, at least two of it:

* Easy to learn (compared to QWERTY)
* Less fatigue (shorter finger travel than QWERTY)
  This one point may differ, according to your main typing language.

Dvorak layout feels more natural to type. One part because the vocal and vowels typing hands are separated, thus allowing more probability for alternating (left-right-left) typing. And another part being the letter placements are specialized for english language. As for another language can still benefit from the first point (alternating typing hands).

I have been using dvorak layout for about 4 months now. I recently measured my typing speed with dvorak, it gave me about 50. I feel that number can still go up and may eventually catch up with my QWERTY speed then. But again, dvorak layout is not about speed, but comfort and accuracy.
